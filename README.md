Grampian Care Data visualised into a dashboard

Important note - the source data used is a snapshot as of 13th November 2016 and is intended for demonstration purposes only. The data is not to be relied on for pratical use.

[OpenRefine](http://openrefine.org) is used to clean and process the source data.

Open both the Categories and Entries files in OpenRefine and then apply the openrefine_operations.json to the data.

Once processed, export Categories as an Excel 2007 file.

Import the file into [dataseed](https://dataseedapp.com) to create the dashboard visualisation of the data.
